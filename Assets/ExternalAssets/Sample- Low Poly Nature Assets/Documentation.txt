1.Important notes:
------------------
- Assets can be rendered without GI by un-checking the "Static" checkbox in
their prefab.

- All asset prefabs are rendered to cast "Two Sided" shadows to prevent cracks
and streaks of light in the projected shadows.

2. Customizing Prefabs:
-----------------------
- All Low Poly Assets were designed with ease of use in mind to save time for the
	developer and ensure the desired look can be achieved in only a few clicks!

	- All of the asset meshes are comprised of sub-meshes, each containing their
	own material.

	To customize the look of a mesh/prefab:
	1. navigate to the prefab (or mesh if you wish to create a new prefab)
	2. In the inspector view, find the "Mesh Renderer" Component and toggle
	the "Materials" drop down menu.
	3. Each element coordinates to a different element of the mesh. To change
	the look of the prefab, drag a material into the element you wish to modify
	or use the selector.

	When creating a new emissive Material:
	1.  Often it is best to test your material on a mesh and render it while you adjust.
		2a. When selecting the emissive value, it can be made simple to get the desired color
		of your albedo by using the color sampler and clicking in the sample box of your
		albedo.
		2b. Sometimes this can result in a very bright and difficult to see material color.
		to fix this, test different emissive values in the emissive texture box, sometimes
		a value as little as 0.05 is all that is required!
